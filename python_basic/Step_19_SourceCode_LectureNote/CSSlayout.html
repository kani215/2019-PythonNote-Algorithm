<p style="font-size:150%; color:red;">Practicing HTML is fun. <br>So far we have learned 
<strong>HTML</strong> is a language made of tags that 
help us describe how we want our webpages to look. 
We have tried the <em>head, title, H(heading),</em>
 and paragraph tags so far. <br>
Very few people know all the tags in HTML, 
but that is okay because we can do a lot with just
 some basic tags. We can learn about new tags when 
 we need them.</p>
